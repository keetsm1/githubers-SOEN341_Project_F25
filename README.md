ðŸ“Œ**Branch Structure**
---
- **`main`**  
  The stable branch containing project code and documentation.

- **Feature Branches (`feature/<name>-<task>`)**  
  Each team member creates their own feature branch for individual tasks or features. Branch names follow the pattern:  
  `feature/<name>-<short-description>`, e.g., `feature/Lorne-login-page`.  

ðŸ“Œ**Workflow**
---
1. Create a feature branch from `main`.  
2. Commit and push changes regularly to relevant feature branch.  
3. When the feature is ready, open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into `main`.  
4. Review the others' PR to catch issues or get feedback.  
5. Once approved, merge the PR and delete the feature branch.
