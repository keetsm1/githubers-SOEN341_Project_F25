### Summary
In Sprint 2, I contributed to **Organizer Event Creation (US.6)**, **Student Event Discovery (US.5)**, and additionally took ownership of implementing the **Friendship feature** end-to-end. My work spanned the **database layer (Supabase schema & RLS policies)**, the **backend service layer (TypeScript API integration)**, and the **frontend (Friends and Events pages)**. This ensured seamless functionality across all layers of the system.
